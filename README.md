# MyPortfolio
Collection of projects completed while i studied towards the Software Development Diploma at Keyin College.

A little about me:
 
 My name is Chris Pinto,  I'm a 24-year-old beginner developer looking to learn new and valuable skills with Keyin's software development program. With a tech passion my whole life I know this is what I was destined to do. Previously, I have done Heavy Equipment and I knew it wasn't the right path for me all along. With a back injury at 24 years old, I was left with two options, go back to heavy equipment and risk my back or pursue a new career and go back to school. 

I'm Currently Working on a Website

I'm Currently Learning CSS
