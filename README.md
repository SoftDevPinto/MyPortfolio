# MyPortfolio
Collection of projects completed while i studied towards the Software Development Diploma at Keyin College.

A little about me:
 
 My names Chris Pinto, im a 24 year old beginner developer looking to learn new and valuable skills with keyins software development program.
With a tech passion my whole life i know this is what i was destined to do. Previously i have done Heavy Equipment and i knew all along it wasnt the right path
for me. With a back injury at 24 years old i was left with two options, go back to heavy equipment and risk my back or pursue a new career and go back to school all over again. As scary as it was i choose the option of schooling and with that i had to move back to St. John's.
